This project is an application skeleton for a typical spring boot web app that is built with gradle. You can use itto quickly bootstrap your webapp projects and dev environment for these projects.
The seed contains a sample spring boot application exposing http resources on port 8080.

The seed app doesn't do much, by default it is listening on path ```/hello``` and returns a String value.
